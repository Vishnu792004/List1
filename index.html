Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board.
                In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league. </p>

            <p>On 13<sup>th</sup> September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, <strong>the BCCI launched the Indian Premier League</strong>, an annual franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition.[24] The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi.</p>
